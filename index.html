    <h1>JavaScript Loops Using <code>for...of</code> and <code>for...in</code>.</h1>

    <p>Earlier this week I was working on a coding problem that involved looping through
      characters in strings. I wanted to loop over all the characters in two strings
      to determine whether they were anagrams. This kind of task is common in
      technical interview situations.</p>

      <p>This made me take a closer look at Javascript for loops. I was especially
      interested in the <code>for...of</code> and <code>for...in</code> loops,
      so I wrote this post to share what I found out.</p>

    <h2>Looping Through Elements in a String using <code>for...of</code></h2>

      <p>So, what's a good way to accomplish this goal? One approach is to use a
        traditional for loop:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <code>
              for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {console.log(string.charAt(i))}
          </code>
        </blockquote>

      <p>This kind of for loop has been around in Javascript since its inception
      twenty years ago. However, ES6 introduced some spiffy new syntax.</p>

      <p>Since the introduction of ES6, you can use a <code>for...of</code> loop:</p>

      <blockquote >
        <code>for (character of string) {console.log(character)}</code>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Isn't the <code>for...of</code> statement much easier to read than the traditional
      for loop! It also requires less typing, which means less room for error.</p>

    <h2>Are <code>for...of</code> and <code>for...in</code> Interchangeable?</h2>

      <p>TLDR: No, they iterate over different things.</p>

      <p>According to MDN:</p>

      <blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of">

        <p>The <code>for...of</code> statement iterates over values that the
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators#Iterables">
          iterable object</a> defines to be iterated over.</p>

        <p>The <code>for...in</code> statement iterates over the
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Enumerability_and_ownership_of_properties">
          enumerable properties</a> of an object, in an arbitrary order.
        </p>

    <h2>What is an <em>iterable object</em>?</h2>

      <p>Definition:<p>
        <blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators#Iterables">
        An object is an <strong>iterable</strong> if it defines its
        iteration behavior, such as what values are looped over in a <code>for...of</code>
        construct.
        </blockquote>

      <p>Here are Javascript's built-in Iterables:
          <ul>
            <li>String</li>
            <li>Array</li>
            <li>TypedArray</li>
            <li>Map</li>
            <li>Set</li>
          </ul>
      </p>

    <h2>What are <em>enumerable properties</em> of an object?</h2>

    <p>Definition:</p>

    <blockquote>Enumerable properties are those properties whose internal enumerable flag
      is set to true, which is the default for properties created via simple
      assignment or via a property initializer (properties defined via
      Object.defineProperty and such default enumerable to false).</blockquote>
