    <h1>JavaScript Loops Using <code>for...of</code> and <code>for...in</code>.</h1>

    <p>Earlier this week I was working on a coding problem that involved looping through
      characters in strings. I wanted to loop over all the characters in two strings
      to determine whether they were anagrams. This kind of task is common in
      technical interview situations.</p>

      <p>This made me take a closer look at Javascript for loops. I was especially
      interested in the <code>for...of</code> and <code>for...in</code> loops,
      so I wrote this post to share what I found out.</p>

    <h2>Looping Through Elements in a String using <code>for...of</code></h2>

      <p>So, what's a good way to accomplish this goal? One approach is to use a
        traditional for loop:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <code>
              for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {console.log(string.charAt(i))}
          </code>
        </blockquote>

      <p>This kind of for loop has been around in Javascript since its inception
      twenty years ago. However, ES6 introduced some spiffy new syntax.</p>

      <p>Since the introduction of ES6, you can use a <code>for...of</code> loop:</p>

      <blockquote >
        <code>for (character of string) {console.log(character)}</code>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Isn't the <code>for...of</code> statement much easier to read than the traditional
      for loop! It also requires less typing, which means less room for error.</p>

    <h2>Are <code>for...of</code> and <code>for...in</code> Interchangeable?</h2>

      <p>TLDR: No, they iterate over different things.</p>

      <p>Per MDN:</p>

      <blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of">

        <p>The <code>for...of</code> statement iterates over values that the
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators#Iterables">
          iterable object</a> defines to be iterated over.</p>

        <p>The <code>for...in</code> statement iterates over the
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Enumerability_and_ownership_of_properties">
          enumerable properties</a> of an object, in an arbitrary order.
        </p>

      </blockquote>

    <h2>What is an <em>iterable object</em>?</h2>
        <p>An object is <strong>iterable</strong> if it defines its
        iteration behavior, such as what values are looped over in a <code>for...of</code>
        construct.
        </p>

      <p>An object defines its iteration behavior when the object (or one of its
        prototypes up its prototype chain) has a property with a <code>Symbol.iterator</code>
        key.</p>

      <p>Here are Javascript's built-in Iterables:
          <ul>
            <li>String</li>
            <li>Array</li>
            <li>TypedArray</li>
            <li>Map</li>
            <li>Set</li>
          </ul>
      </p>

      <blockquote><code></code></blockquote>

    <h2>What are <em>enumerable properties</em> of an object?</h2>

      <p>According to MDN, enumerable properties are those <em>properties</em> whose
        internal enumerable flag is set to true.</p>

      <p>This was a little cryptic to me at first glance. How can you tell
      whether an internal enumerable flag is set to true for a property?</p>

      <p>Well, it turns out that there is a method baked right into the Object.prototype
      that answers this question. The method is called <code>propertyIsEnumerable()</code>.</p>

      <p>Once again MDN has a great example demonstrating how to use this method to
      check whether a specified property is enumerable. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/propertyIsEnumerable">Here</a> is
      a link to MDN's example.</p>

    <h2>Back to My Example</h2>

      <p>Let's take a look back at our example to confirm whether <code>for...of</code>
        and/or <code>for...in</code> works:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <code>
          let myString = "valar morghulis"<br>
          <br>
          "hello world"[Symbol.iterator]()<br>
          // StringIterator {}<br>
          <br>
          console.log(myString.propertyIsEnumerable([1]))
          <br>
          // true
        </code>
      </blockquote>

      <p>As demonstrated above, strings have the Symbol.iterator method.
        In addition, strings are indexed by character. Thus, you can use
        <code>for...of</code> or a <code>for...in</code> statement to iterate over
        characters in a string.</p>
